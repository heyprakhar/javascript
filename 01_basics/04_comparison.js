console.log(2>1);
console.log("2">1);//expected o/p = true , as 2 is converted to number automatically
console.log("2" == 2); // changes the 2 from string to number and then compares ; expected answer = true    
console.log("2"=== 2); // strictly checks two quantities even the datatypes ; expected answer = false
